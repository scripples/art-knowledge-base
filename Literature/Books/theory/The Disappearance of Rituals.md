## 2. The Compulsion of Authenticity

Establishes the state of authenticity in contemporary (liberal) society as yet another site of production and commodification. Authenticity, as it exists for liberal thought, happens at the expense of the social, of ritual and it symbols, which are cast off as 'mere artifice.' Ritual and symbols are the source of deadly serious play, of theater, of supposition and the ability of something to be (even in passing) something other than itself. Authenticity in its purest form forbids this practice.

Somewhat related is art -- Han's claim is that the cult of authenticity is also partly responsible for turning art from magic, of forms which stand on their own and engender themselves -- to discourse, of forms which must give themselves up to discourse, which must evaporate in order to perform intellectual labor.
		
		"The imperative of transparency fosters an animosity to form."
		
		"Instead we are confronted with simplified claims and messages that are artificially imposed on the work of art."

		"Art is not a discourse. It produces its effects through forms and signifiers, not through the signified."
