author: [[Carlos Fuentes]]

It was all right at best, not half as good as I remember, a ghost story. A young man (student of languages) responds to an ad in the paper (because I needed the money), an old woman offers to pay him a generous sum in exchange for his transcription of her deceased husband's wartime notes from French.

The notes themselves are lackluster -- florid, a little boring. The man quickly falls in love with the old woman's niece (Aura). As time goes on, the man's identity and the general's become muddled, the old woman and her niece's collapse into one-another, the old woman is a shaman or a witch, she summons forth her younger self for days at a time, which the young man loves, and he agrees to stay forever.
